# Are All Data Points Created Equal?

---

> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

##-Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

#Being data-driven doesn't mean blindly following data.

# Types of Analysis

---

# 1. Quantifying Needs
--

+ How much of X do I need?
--

+ Analyzing inputs (resources, people, etc.)
--

+ How much does my need change given a different set of conditions?
--

+ What are the conditions that influence X?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ How does X play into my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ What’s the most meaningful way of quantifying X?
---

<!-- quantifying needs examples -->

---

# 2. Operational Analysis
--

+ What is my organization doing?
--

+ Assessment
--

+ How might my organization do things better?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ What are your organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ How do your employees do their work?
--

+ What’s the best way to measure this work?

---

# 3. Performance Metrics
--

+ How is my organization doing?
--

+ Monitoring and evaluation
--

+ How do we make this data visible to the people who need it?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ What is most important to measure (think mission and goals)?
--

+ How do we best measure performance?
