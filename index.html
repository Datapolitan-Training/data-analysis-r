# Are All Data Points Created Equal?

# Types of Analysis

---

# 1. Quantifying Needs
--

+ How much of X do I need?
--

+ Analyzing inputs (resources, people, etc.)
--

+ How much does my need change given a different set of conditions?
--

+ What are the conditions that influence X?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ How does X play into my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ What’s the most meaningful way of quantifying X?
---

<!-- quantifying needs examples -->

---

# 2. Operational Analysis
--

+ What is my organization doing?
--

+ Assessment
--

+ How might my organization do things better?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ What are your organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ How do your employees do their work?
--

+ What’s the best way to measure this work?

---

# 3. Performance Metrics
--

+ How is my organization doing?
--

+ Monitoring and evaluation
--

+ How do we make this data visible to the people who need it?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ What is most important to measure (think mission and goals)?
--

+ How do we best measure performance?

#Goodhart's Law

## - Charles Goodhart, Economist

---

# 4. Prioritization

+ How do I meet optimal outcomes with limited resources?
--

+ Optimizing allocation
--

+ Important considerations:

+ Minimize disruption
--

+ Work within current workflow
--

#4 TYPES OF CONCERNS TO BE MINDFUL OF

---

# 1. Technical
--

+ Having the right tools
--

+ Having the people who can use them
--

+ Making everything work together
--

+ _Potential trap: having a solution in search of a problem_
---

# 2. Legal
--

+ Laws
--

+ Regulations
--

+ Practices
--

+ _Potential trap: not doing something because of mistaken assumptions_
---

<!-- HIPAA example -->

---

# 3. Cultural
--

+ “We’ve always done it this way”
--

+ “I’m not sure I understand how this works”
--

+ _Potential trap: being afraid of rocking the boat_
---

# 4. Political
--

+ Inter-departmental
--

+ Intra-departmental
--

+ Public relations
--

+ _Potential trap: not putting the necessary effort into something that will pay dividends to your agency and ultimately to the city as a whole_
