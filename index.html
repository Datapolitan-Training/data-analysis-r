# Are All Data Points Created Equal?

---

> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

##-Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

#Being data-driven doesn't mean blindly following data.

# Types of Analysis

---

# 1. Quantifying Needs
--

+ How much of X do I need?
--

+ Analyzing inputs (resources, people, etc.)
--

+ How much does my need change given a different set of conditions?
--

+ What are the conditions that influence X?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ How does X play into my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ What’s the most meaningful way of quantifying X?
---

<!-- quantifying needs examples -->

---

# 2. Operational Analysis
--

+ What is my organization doing?
--

+ Assessment
--

+ How might my organization do things better?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ What are your organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ How do your employees do their work?
--

+ What’s the best way to measure this work?

---

# 3. Performance Metrics
--

+ How is my organization doing?
--

+ Monitoring and evaluation
--

+ How do we make this data visible to the people who need it?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ What is most important to measure (think mission and goals)?
--

+ How do we best measure performance?

# 6 Analytical Steps
![img-center-90](images/sixphases_1.jpg)

---

# 1. Problem Formulation
--

+ What question or need am I trying to answer?
--

+ What’s my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ How can I best apply data to this task?

---

# 2. Data Gathering/Preliminary Analysis
--

+ What data do I think I’m going to need?
--

+ What condition is it in?
--

+ Does it tell me what I need?
--

+ What other data might I need?
--

+ How much work do I need to put into the data?

---

# 3. Data Cleaning/Data Munging
--

+ Make the data usable and compatible
--

+ Takes up the most amount of time
--

+ May require more sophisticated tools depending on the state and size of the data

---

# 4. Hypothesis Testing
--

+ Am I getting the results I’d hoped for?
--

+ What other questions come up?
---

# 5. Verification
--

+ Do my results make sense?
--

+ Did I make a simple mistake?
--

+ Check twice and you’ll sleep easier
---

<!-- Reinhart example -->

---

<!-- 88% of spreadsheets have errors -->

---

# 6. Visualization
--

+ “A picture is worth a thousand words”
--

+ Communicate results clearly and concisely
--

+ Help to better understand your data
--

+ The eyes have a much higher bandwidth into the brain
