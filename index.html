# Are All Data Points Created Equal?

---

##-Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

#Being data-driven doesn't mean blindly following data.

# Types of Analysis

# 1. Quantifying Needs
--

+ How much of X do I need?
--

+ Analyzing inputs (resources, people, etc.)

+ What are the conditions that influence X?
--

+ Important Considerations:
--

+ How does X play into my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ What’s the most meaningful way of quantifying X?
---

<!-- quantifying needs examples -->

---

# 3. Performance Metrics
--

+ How is my organization doing?
--

+ Monitoring and evaluation
--

+ How do we make this data visible to the people who need it?
